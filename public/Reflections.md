# Reflection For CS3 1st Quarter
### By Zirjan Hero F. Mendaro

1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.
* Arithmetic Operators - The operators used in js were very similar to C++ where we already discussed during grade 8. And in grade 8 this was used a lot for different activities.
* Comparison Operators - This operator was also similar to C++ because it had ==, !=, >, < signs which was already also discussed in grade 8. Also we had many excersises where we used them but while it was similar there were additions like strictly ===.
* Conditional Statements - Statements like if, if else, and else were also discussed in grade 8 for C++ so we had prior knowledge to how they worked. Also our project and excerse during grade 8 used a lot of conditional statements and also loop statements.
* Loop Statements - Same as conditional statements, do while , while, and for loops were discussed in grade 8. And was incorporated in many activities.
* Variable Declaration - C++ variable declaration was kind of similar to java script because of the same similar data types. Variable Declaration for javascript was just different because it used let, const, and var, while C++ used int.
2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.
